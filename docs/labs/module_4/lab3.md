# Lab 3 - Signing an app using catalog signing

## Download Windows SDK (to get signtool.exe)

https://developer.microsoft.com/sv-se/windows/downloads/windows-sdk/

Click on "Ladda ner installationsprogrammet" :)
Open winsdksetup.exe
Chose Install and press Next, Next, Accept

Uncheck everything except "Windows SDK Signing Tools for Desktop Apps" and click Install
![alt text](/img/mod4-lab3-img1.jpg)

Close the window.

Open a new Terminal and verify that you now have access to signtool.exe.
It should be located in 
> `C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\bin\10.0.26100.0\x64`


## Install and create a catalog file for an application:

It turs out, modern application developers are pretty good at signing their binaries, but I managed to find a software that is unsigned and that we also can use in this lab - CFF Explorer. 

Start by downloading CFF Explorer from here [https://ntcore.com/files/ExplorerSuite.exe](https://ntcore.com/files/ExplorerSuite.exe). Save it to C:\Install

Start packageinspector like we did in Module 3:
`packageinspector.exe start C: -path C:\install\ExplorerSuite.exe`

Start the installer of CFF Explorer by doubleclicking `C:\install\ExplorerSuite.exe`, confirm all defaults and Press Finish to close the installation when the Installation was successful.

Stop PackageInspector and provide a path to a .cat-file and a .cdf-file
`PackageInspector.exe stop c: -out cat -name c:\install\cffexplorer.cat -cdfpath c:\install\cffexplorer.cdf`

## Inspect and Sign the catalog file

Get the filehashes of all the installed files:
get-childitem -recurse Get-ChildItem -Recurse "C:\Program Files\NTCore\Explorer Suite" | Get-FileHash

Doubleclick c:\install\cffexplorer.cat and click the Security Catalog tab.
Can you find some of the hashes? Why or why not?

Open CFF Explorer on the start menu and open one of the files you *did'nt* find a matching hash for.
CFF Explorer can display the SHA-1 or MD5 embedded hash in the files.

Sign the cat file:

& 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\bin\10.0.26100.0\x64\signtool.exe' sign /n "CodeSign" /fd sha256 /v C:\install\cffexplorer.cat

That should result in this message:
```
The following certificate was selected:
    Issued to: CodeSign
    Issued by: appcontrol-ca01-CA
    Expires:   Wed Oct 15 11:47:56 2025
    SHA1 hash: 3078086484D9242BD39D8971C419E07C61096BDA

Done Adding Additional Store
Successfully signed: C:\install\cffexplorer.cat

Number of files successfully Signed: 1
Number of warnings: 0
Number of errors: 0
```

Doubleclick C:\install\cffexplorer.cat
Click on View Signature and see that the file is now signed with our CodeSign-certificate and that the signature is valid.

In order for a computer to trust a catalog file, Windows needs to know of it's existance. For Kernel drivers, that cat file is always stored in the same directory as the other driver files. For our own signed catalogs, we need to distribute the cat file to `%windir%\System32\catroot\{F750E6C3-38EE-11D1-85E5-00C04FC295EE}`




If we run 
PS C:\Users\RobinEngstrÃ¶m> Get-AuthenticodeSignature "C:\Program Files\NTCore\Explorer Suite\Task Explorer.exe"


    Directory: C:\Program Files\NTCore\Explorer Suite


SignerCertificate                         Status                                               Path
-----------------                         ------                                               ----
                                          NotSigned                                            Task Explorer.exe



Copy the signed cat file to catroot:
Microsofts have a few suggestions on how this can be done with Group Policy or ConfigMgr [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/application-security/application-control/app-control-for-business/deployment/deploy-catalog-files-to-support-appcontrol)

`copy-item C:\install\cffexplorer.cat "c:\windows\System32\catroot\{F750E6C3-38EE-11D1-85E5-00C04FC295EE}"`


## Add our signing certificate to our App Control Policy

```powershell
Add-SignerRule -FilePath 'C:\Policies\Mod3Lab2-Win11-Base.xml' -CertificatePath C:\Policies\codesign-public.cer -User
```

Open 'C:\Policies\Mod3Lab2-Win11-Base.xml' and find our singning certificate under <Signers>
Scroll down to SigningScenario value 12 (this is the User Mode part of the policy) and verify that the SignerId is also stored there.


Optionally:
Deploy and test the policy
