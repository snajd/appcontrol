# Lab 3 - Examine the Example Policies


Windows comes bundled with a handful of Code Integrity policies that can be very useful to start from when building our own. These are stored in xml-format in the `C:\Windows\schemas\CodeIntegrity\ExamplePolicies\` folder

1.	Navigate to the path for the example policies, noted above, and open a few of them. Get a feel for the structure of the XML file elements. Make sure you find the Rules element and look at the configured RuleOptions for the different policies you examine.
2.	Try to find in what element or key the *name* and *version* of a specific policy is configured. These are important value to know and update as wee saw in the previous exercise (this is the values shown in the different log files and command outputs)
